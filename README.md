# NeuralNetwork

## Description
In this project, I created a Neural Network model without the use of any models from popular ML libraries. This simple model has 1 hidden layer and a customizable number of hidden layer nodes. dElu and sigmoid activation functions are used on the hidden layer and output layer, respectively. I used this model to predict the binary classification of a sklearn make_moons dataset, a simple dataset consisting of points with 2 positional features each. Probabilistic classification determines which of the two moon shapped clusters a data point belongs to.
